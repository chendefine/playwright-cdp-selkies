# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Only the latest published image tag (and `main`) receive updates. Pin by digest or `major.minor` tag if you need reproducibility.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities **privately** to the repository owner via
[GitHub security advisories](https://github.com/chendefine/playwright-cdp-selkies/security/advisories/new)
("Report a vulnerability"), or email the maintainer if an address is listed on
the GitHub profile. Do **not** open a public issue for security problems.

Include if possible: steps to reproduce, affected versions/tags, impact
assessment, and any mitigations. You should hear back within a week.

## Security posture of the image

Understand this posture **before** exposing any port:

| Surface | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CDP endpoint (port 9222) | **no authentication** | Full browser control for anyone who can reach it. Publish to localhost/trusted networks only. |
| Selkies web UI (port 80/443) | no authentication | Set `SELKIES_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` (+ HTTPS) whenever untrusted parties can connect. |
| TLS | self-signed, generated once | Bring your own certificate for anything public. |
| Chromium sandbox | `--no-sandbox` | Standard for containerized Chromium; run the container on a host/VM you'd be comfortable exposing a browser to. |
| Container user | root (PID 1 binds ports 80/443) | Consider `--cap-drop=ALL --security-opt=no-new-privileges`. |

These are deliberate trade-offs for a single-container developer tool, not
oversights. See [Security considerations](README.md#security-considerations)
for hardening options.
